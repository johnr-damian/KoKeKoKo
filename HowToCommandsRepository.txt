Create a CSV file named "CommandsRepository"
For classification of commands, check page 11 of Thesis paper:
	Army - Concerns on building units and production structures that create those units. The player may need to build more production structures if resources are rising faster than the spending of the player. Units is for engaging combat, which allows the player to defend and attack against the opponent.
	Tech - Encompasses on constructing buildings to progress down the tech tree to create new units and structures, or spending on upgrades that enhances the existing units. Unlocking the tech tree allows the player to create more and varying powerful units. On the other hand, upgrading makes the units stronger and more versatile.
	Economy - Spending on Economy means investing that will increase the rate of gathering resources or creating Supply. Creating new worker units allows the player to collect minerals and gas at a higher rate. Constructing new bases allow the player to have more resource patches.
The format of the CSV should be:
